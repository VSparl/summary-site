# Economics II

## GDP

- **nominal** GDP:
    - value of all goods and services in a coutry
    - doesn't account for inflation &rightarrow; uses today's currency
    - value is higher than that of real GDP
- **real** GDP:
    - value of all goods and services in a country
    - adjusted for inflation &rightarrow; comparison to base year
    - value is lower than that of nominal GDP

## Economic Growth

> _An increase in the amount of goods and services produced per head of the population over a period of time._

Economic growth leads to:

- higher purchasing power
- higher production & availability of goods
- government has more money to maintain / expand inrfastructure

### Sources of Growth

**Labour**:

- **labour force potential**: all pepople within a society that are actually willing to work
- **productivity of labour**: quantity of produced services / goods for 1h of work

**Real Capital**:

- **amount** of real capital: non-financial assets like machines, employees or forests
- **productivity** of real capital: _efficiency_ of the means of production[^1]

**Knowledge**:

- **human capital**: experience and skills of the workers
- **technological progress**

[^1]: This could be e.g. how many bottles per hour a factory machine produces

**Natural Resources**:

- **amount of resources**
- **productivity of resources**: how well the resources are put to use

## Sustainable Growth

> Sustainability is the act of fulfilling the current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to do so

- _social_: **Gini coefficient** measures inequalities in income / wealth distribution
- _environment_: **Emissions Trading System** allows companies to trade the right to emitting greenhouse gases
- _economic_: **public debt** indicates how well a state manages public money

!!! tip "Justification of Public Debt"
    - loans should finance projects with projected long-term revenue (e.g. infrastructure)
    - if loans are used for e.g. defense (no long-term returns) &rightarrow; interest may not be covered
    
    rules for borrowing money:

    1. spend loans on things that **create value** so you can pay back the debt with interest
    2. the debt should **never grow faster than the economy**, else paying it back will be hard
    3. spending should increase at the same rate as the economy

## Swiss Debt Brake

Switzerland has safeguards in place to stabilise the debt level and avoid a rapid increase in public debt as it happened the last time in the 1990s:

- government spending is not allowed to overshoot income over time
- during economic booms &rightarrow; use surplus revenues to pay off debt
- during recessions &rightarrow; taking on debt is permitted
- result: **economic balance** accross economic cycles
- debt brake allows debt during crises _(e.g. pandemics or wars)_, but it should be paid off as soon as possible

## Business cycles

- irregular but **periodic** up-and-down movement in economic activity
- economic growth can be strongly influenced by crises, wars, pandemics etc.

Different phases in the economic cycle:

- **Boom**:
    - economy is strong
    - people are **spending more** due to **increased wages** and **more jobs**
    - investments and entrepreneurship thrive &rightarrow; many new businesses
    - risk of **rising inflation** due to strong demand
- **Downturn** (Contraction):
    - economy is declining
    - people are **spending less** due to **layoffs**
    - companies cut costs and investments
    - can precede a _recession_
- **Recession**:
    - **rising unemployment** causes **lower demand**
    - potential for **falling inflation rate**
    - production & import slows with declining customer demand
    - can precede a _depression_
- **Upturn**:
    - economy resumes its growth
    - **lower unemployment** due to businesses hiring again
    - **rising demand and consumer spending** as financial stability is regained
    - **growing investments** as companies prepare for future growth again
