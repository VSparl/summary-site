    Not all exam topics are covered here! These are just the part that I personally found useful to have written down. You can find the learning objectives on **OneNote > _Inhaltsbibliothek > Organisation > Exams > 24.02.2025 - Learning objectives** 

## Price Elasticity

### Demand
The price elasticity of **demand** shows how much a change in *price* influences the *demand* for a certain product. It is calculated using

$\text{Ed} = \frac{\Delta D}{\Delta P}$

where $\Delta D$ is the relative change (in $\%$) of the quantity **demanded** and $\Delta P$ is the relative change (also in $\%$) of the **price**.

- $\text{Ed} > 1$: Demand is *price elastic* 
- $\text{Ed} < 1$: Demand is *price inelastic*
- $\text{Ed} = 1$: Demand curve has *unitary elasticity*

???+ example "Example: Airplane tickets (**high** elasticity)"

    - low prices &rightarrow; high demand
    - slightly higher prices &rightarrow; significantly lower demand
    - Conclusion: People can easily live without the product if it rises above a comfortable price

???+ example "Example: Petrol (**low** elasticity)"

    - low prices &rightarrow; slightly above-average demand
    - high prices &rightarrow; slightly below-average demand
    - Conclusion: People need petrol to drive their cars (e.g. to work), so they can't be too picky when it comes to the price

### Supply
The price elasticity of **supply** shows how much a change in *price* influences the *supply* for a certain product. It is calculated using

$\text{Es} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta P}$

where $\Delta S$ is the relative change (in $\%$) of the quantity **supplied** and $\Delta P$ is the relative change (also in $\%$) of the **price**.

- $\text{Es} > 1$: Supply is *price elastic* 
- $\text{Es} < 1$: Supply is *price inelastic*
- $\text{Es} = 1$: Supply curve has *unitary elasticity*

???+ example "Example: T-shirt production (**high** elasticity)"

    - low selling price &rightarrow; few units produced
    - slightly higher selling price &rightarrow; significantly more units produced
    - Conclusion: The amount of produced units is sensitive to price changes and therefore more elastic

???+ example "Example: Nuclear power (**low** elasticity)"

    - low selling price &rightarrow; no new power plants are built
    - high selling price &rightarrow; few new power plants are built, and slowly
    - Conclusion: Price changes don't affect the amount of power plants too much

## Overhangs

- **supply** overhang (surplus): more supply than demand &rightarrow; *lower* the price to reach equilibrium
- **demand** overhang (shortage): more demand than supply &rightarrow; *increase* the price to reach equilibrium


## Types of Economies

### Centrally Planned Economy

- **socialism**: equality among the people
- state plans the entire economy:
    - production of goods
    - distribution of goods
    - pricing
    - amount of goods produced
    - etc.
- state owns means of production
- state gets the profits

Examples: North Korea, Cuba, Soviet Union

### Free Market Economy

- **liberalism**: personal responsibility & rights
- economy is influenced by consumer behaviour
- production is owned by private companies
- profits go to company

Example: America

!!! info "Switzerland - a social market economy"
    Switzerland is **neither** of the two structures mentioned above. Instead, it combines state-owned services (SBB, Swiss post, Swisscom) with private companies. This is called a **social market economy**. Other examples include France or Germany.


## Market Interventions

When the **government** has to intervene in the market to **adjust market conditions**.

### Market-conforming

Examples: raising taxes, subsidies, regulations

- intervention still allows market dynamics to function
- the market is "*nudged*" into the desired direction
- supply and demand still work, and a **new market equilibrium** is reached
- works *with* market forces

### Non-market-conforming

Examples: price limits, import/export limits, direct provision of goods/services[^1]

- intervention breaks market dynamics
- the market has to comply with the new restrictions
- disrupt supply & demand &rightarrow; shortages & surpluses
- works *against* market forces or replaces them entirely[^2]

[^1]: When the state directly provides a good/service to take control from private companies
[^2]: As is the case when a good/service is provided *entirely* by the government
