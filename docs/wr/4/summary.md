## Legal Subjects and Objects

### Legal subjects

- have **rights** and **obligations**
- can participate in legal life
- can be **natural persons** *(individual humans)*
- can be **legal persons** *(artificial entities created by law)*

> Examples for a **legal person** would be a company (like a GmbH or an AG). Here, it's **not** the shareholders, the CEO or similar, but rather the "legal concept" of the **company itself** that has rights and obligations.

### Legal objects

- things that the rights of legal subjects **refer to**
- can be **tangible** *(e.g. books, bread, a piece of land, ...)*
- can be **intangible** *(e.g. copyright, patent rights, ...)*

> Copyright, patent rights, licenses etc. all refer to the concept of **intellectual property**

!!! note "Animals"
    Animals are legal objects in most cases, as they can be bought, sold, moved around etc. without asking them. They have *some* rights though (e.g. animal protection rights). However, they have another rule set than legal persons.


## Legal Capacity and Capacity to Act

### Legal capacity

- makes you a **legal subject**
- as a natural person, you get it **at birth** *(for your whole life)*
- as a legal person, the company gets it when it's entered into the **commercial register**[^1]

[^1]: A register of **all** companies in a canton, country or similar

## Capacity to act

- lets you act **on your behalf** *(sign contracts, enter obligations, etc.)*
- **no consent** needed from guardians, caretakers, etc.

### Requirements

1. You are **of age** *(18 years in most parts of the world)*
2. You are **capable of judgement** *(can act rationally)*

Typical situations in which the capacity of judgement is **not fulfilled**:

- underage *(younger than 8 years old in CH)*
- intoxication *(alcohol, drugs etc.)*
- mental issues *(schizophrenia, Alzheimer etc.)*

### Subcategories of incapacity to act

**Full** incapacity: neither of age nor capable of judgement

- guardians must **act on behalf** of the person
- legal agreements entered by the person are **invalid**
- **cannot commit to obligations** on their own

> Examples:
> 
> - You're under 8 years old (&rightarrow; <18 and <8)
> - You have schizophrenia at 13 years old (&rightarrow; <18 and incapable of judgement)
> - You're 17 and drunk (&rightarrow; <18 and incapable of judgement)

---

**Limited** incapacity: not of age, but capable of judgement

- can commit to obligations with the **agreement of their legal representatives** *(parents, guardians, or similar)*
- some cases don't require consent from parents:
    - free benefits *(includes gifts)*
    - minor everyday matters
    - own earnings and pocket money

> If you're reading this, you probably have limited incapacity. You're not 18 yet, but are (hopefully) capable of judgement.


## Legal Proceedings

!!! tip ""In dubio pro reo""
    **Doubt** of the judge must always be **beneficial to the defendant**. The **burden of proof** is still on the accuser

### Civil proceedings

- one **citizen** sues **another citizen**
- **plaintiff** *(= "accuser")* versus **defendant** *(= "accused")*
- a **peace judge** has to be consulted first *(before going to civil court)*
- dispute is solved when a **settlement** is reached
- if no settlement is reached &rightarrow; **appeal** to higher court

### Criminal proceedings

- the **state** sues a **citizen**
- **prosecutor** *(= representative of state)* versus **defendant** *(= criminal)*
- trial can result in an **acquittal** *(= not guilty)* or a **conviction** *(= guilty)*

### Administrative proceedings

- a **citizen** sues the **state**
- citizens can **object to government decisions** by filing an objection
- if the answer regarding your objection is unsatisfactory &rightarrow; **appeal**


## Sources of Obligations

- **contract** (Art. 1 et seqq.[^2] CC): parties give consent to enter an obligation *(work contracts, purchases, tenancies, ...)*
- **tort** (Art. 41 et seqq. CC): person ist obligated to pay for damages caused *(vandalism, theft, destruction of property, ...)*
- **unjust enrichment** (Art. 62 et seqq. CC): obligation to pay back money that wasn't intended for you *(money transferred twice, to the wrong person, ...)*

[^2]: Lat. "et sequentes" &rightarrow; "and the following [ones]"


## Fault-Based Liability

If you cause damage, you're usually liable yourself.

Prerequisites (based on Art. 41 CO):

1. **unlawfulness**: a law needs to have been broken; exceptions:
    1. **self-defence**: you may defend yourself, even if it breaks some laws
    2. **consent**: you have explicit permission to break a **legal right** *(not a fundamental right)*
2. **causality**: the cause must be in reasonable relation to the effect:
    1. **natural causality**: circumstance is a necessary prerequisite for the damage to have occurred
    2. **adequate causal connection**: whether the behaviour would typically result in the damage
3. **damage**: in involuntary reduction in assets needs to have occurred:
    1. **bodily injuries**: costs resulting from injuries need to be covered *(includes incapacity to work)*
    2. **material damage**: costs resulting from the replacement or repair of physical objects
4. **fault**: it must be the fault of the accused person:
    1. **intent**: the damage was caused with intent
    2. **negligence**: necessary care was not shown &rightarrow; differentiation between moderate / gross negligence


## Causal liability

Sometimes you're responsible for the damages that other people cause.

- **liability of employers** (Art. 55 CO): liable for damages done by employees while working
- **liability for animals** (Art. 56 CO): liable for damages caused by ones animal
- **liability of property owners** (Art. 58 CO): property owners *(buildings, roads, ...)* are liable for damages caused by defects in the property
- **liability of the head of the family** (Art 333 CC): head of the family is liable for damages caused by members without capacity to act

!!! tip "Exceptions"
    In each case, if the person liable can show that they took **adequate precautions** to avoid the situation, they are **exempt** from the liability.
