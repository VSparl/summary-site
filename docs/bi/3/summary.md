## Meiosis

Similar to **mitosis**, but for production of **haploid[^1] gametes**

     Interchromosomal recombination is included in the process

[^1]: with only one chromosome of each type and only one chromatid per chromosome &rightarrow; **1n, 1c**
### Sources of genetic variation

Interchromosomal recombination:

- also called "**crossing over**"
- aleles on different chromosomes can **switch places**
- occurs during **prophase I**

Random orientation of chromosomes:

- chromosomes are pulled apart in **anaphase I**
- when pulled, they are **not sorted** by who originally supplied them, but assigned randomly

### Non-disjunction

- chromatids are not separated properly
- can happen during **anaphase I or II**
- leads to gametes with **abnormal chromosome numbers**


## Mendelian laws

!!! warning "Punnett squares"
    We practised punnet squares and percentages so much that they will not be explained here. So don't forget that you also need to know how to use Punnett squares on the test :)

- **law of uniformity**: offspring of homozygous[^2] parents all look the same
- **law of reciprocity**: doesn't matter which alleles are from which parent
- **law of segregation**: each gamete only carries one allele
- **law of new combinations**: new genotypes[^3] *(and thus new phenotypes[^4])* can occur


[^2]: Both alleles are the same
[^3]: combinations of alleles to form genes
[^4]: observable characteristics of specific genotypes

## Blood types

### Co-dominance

The $I^A$ and $I^B$ alleles are co-dominant. This means that they are both dominant over the $i$ allele, but not over each other. This allows type $AB$ blood to exist, because $I^A$ and $I^B$ **do not exclude each other**.
