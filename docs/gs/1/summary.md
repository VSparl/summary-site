## Pre-Colonial Population

### Iroquois Confederacy

Many populations lived on the territory we call America today. Some of these populations, though remaining mostly independent, formed an alliance called the **Iroquois Confederacy**[^1]

- territory is today's New York state
- traded with everyone, weren't allied with a particular side
- not mainly hunters, but traders
- longhouses as settlements
- pride in tribe; also fought among themselves
- fought against the **French**, **English** and **Dutch**
- warrior society; fearsome military for natives and Europeans alike
- includes 5 indian nations (see map)
- _Mohawks_[^2] - Middlemen in trade with Europeans
- _Senecas_[^3] - Fur suppliers for trade

### Agriculture - Corn

Although it hadn't arrived in north america yet, **corn** revolutionized the way tribes lived **in south America**

<!--prettier-ignore-->
- different times of arrival caused different rates of development in the tribes
- North American equivalent of South American societies didn't exist
- nomadic hunter tribes settled and made agricultural villages
- corn, along with beans and [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita "Wikipedia - squash (plant)") made "three sisters" farming possible
- optimal usage of soil and humidity for growing food through **"three sister farming"**:
    1. Corn grows tall, creating a natural trellis[^4] that the beans can climb up.
    2. Beans fix nitrogen in the soil, providing a natural fertilizer that helps the corn grow.
    3. Squash spreads out along the ground, covering the soil with its large leaves, which helps keep moisture in the soil and blocks weeds.
- very high population densities due to efficient farming
- besides agriculture, native societies didn't artificially alter the nature much

## European Colonies

### Colonial Division

After the first successful English colony in **Virginia in 1607**, more colonies started to develop.<br>
The three colonial groups:

1. **new England colonies**: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut
2. **middle colonies**: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware
3. **southern colonies**: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia

Not only the English had colonies in America, but also other european nations:

### Population Growth

The population in the American colonies saw a massive increase around the year 1700, for several reasons:

- **high birth rate**: average American family had 7 children
- **low death rate**: better food availability in America lead to longer lives than most Europeans
- **immigration**: many Europeans came to America

While the population grew, the _population density_ still wasn't too high, as most people lived on scattered farms.

### Immigration

Common reasons for emigration[^5] to America:

- **economic issues**: bad harvests, declining linen trade _(mostly affecting Scotland & Ireland)_
- **religion**: religious freedom was much more prominent in America

Most people emigrated under a **system of temporary servitude**, in which they enter a contract[^6] to offer their labour (usually for 4 years) in exchange for free passage accross the Atlantic.

### Slavery

While the first slaves were already brought to Virginia at the beginning of the 17^th^ century, slavery didn't have it's boom until the 18^th^ century. Then the amount of slaves soared up to 17% of the population.

- **high demand for slaves**: black population grew faster than white population
- **90% of slaves were in the south**, with the most in South Carolina
